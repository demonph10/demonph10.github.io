I am supervised by [Bing-Kun Bao](https://www.scholat.com/bkbao) (鲍秉坤), [Guanming Lu](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52A2A2DCFE050007F01006EFE) (卢官明), [Zhiyi Tan](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9bdfc80eeae644a3b917ce6816b458f3) (谭智一) from NJUPT, and [Shengsheng Qian](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~shengshengqian) (钱胜胜) from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (中科院自动化所). Currently, I am interning at 360 AI Research Institute.

To date, I have been honored with the Jiangsu Provincial Merit Student award, China Telecom Scholarship, Jiangsu Puxin Elite Scholarship, and NJUPT Person of the Year award.

My research focuses on social computing, including social media analysis and recommender systems. I have published 4 papers at ACM MM, AAAI, and TKDD. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for ACM MM, TMM, PR, CIKM and other conferences/journals.
